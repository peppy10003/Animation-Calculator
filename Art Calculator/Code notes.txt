Input:
	Video length or Number of Frames (length) 90f
	Frames done an hour (Average) 9fph

	Frames done (FD) 30f
	
Output:
	estimated time spent (second)
	estimated time left (first)
	estimated percentage done (last)

Calculating:
	length / Average = *Hours needed*
	(length - FD) / Average = *Time left*
	FD / Average = *Time done*
	Length / FD = *Percentage*
